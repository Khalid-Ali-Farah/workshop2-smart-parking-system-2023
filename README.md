## Features

- **Car Plate Recognition**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for accurate car plate detection, achieving over 90% accuracy before using OCR to recognize the plate text.
- **Booking Module**: Allows users to book a specific parking lot, date, and time. Users can extend their booking time before or after parking.
- **QRCode Module**: Generates an encrypted QR code using AES encryption for vehicle retrieval, enhancing security and convenience.

## Advantages

- Reduces car congestion at parking gates.
- Eliminates the hassle of losing or misplacing parking tickets.
- Provides a seamless parking experience through easy booking and automated vehicle recognition.
